             on the historical trail at Dumre Bazaar to a town that has hardly changed. Well preserved Bandipur today

            flying like a bird in the thermals all the while enjoying views of snow capped mountains,
            pristine lakes and verdant valleys like nowhere else on earth. With experienced pilots to guide you
            through the skies, it's an experience of a life time. You may fly again someday, but you'll never
            enjoy the same spectacular views. Choose from tandem flights to fully certified paragliding courses,
            solo flights or even go paragliding accompanied by hawks!

            museum of Newari culture, a beautifully preserved village crowning a lofty ridge, its main street lined 
            with traditional row houses. Time seems to have stood still here, although it has taken a lot of effort 
            to preserve this magic while developing the town as a destination. Derelict buildings have been reborn as 
            cafes and lodges, and temples and civic buildings have been pulled back from the edge of ruin. 
            With its attractive 18th-century architecture, pedestrian zone and outdoor dining, it has a distinctly 
            European feel.
